# IMPORTANT: If your 'storellai-c5ff1089f6b5.json' key file is located
# OUTSIDE this 'story-to-mp3-audiobook-generator' directory (e.g., in the parent 'storellai-audiobook' folder),
# then it is NOT part of this Git repository and does not need to be listed here.
# If you were to move the key file INSIDE this 'story-to-mp3-audiobook-generator'
# directory (e.g., to its root), then you would add its name here:
storellai-c5ff1089f6b5.json
